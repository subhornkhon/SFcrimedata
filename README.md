# Visualizing Geospatial data
  Applied data visualization library in Python (Folium) to visualize crime rate in San Francisco. This is a part of Data visualization course in Coursera.
  ## Data set
  Based on the San Francisco crime dataset, it contains 10 main neighborhoods in San Francisco with its crime rate. In this assignment, we  create a Choropleth map to visualize crime in San Francisco.  A choropleth map displays numerical data using a color gradient on a map.
